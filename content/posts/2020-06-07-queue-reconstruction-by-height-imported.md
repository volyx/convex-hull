Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers (h, k), where h is the height of the person and k is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to h. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

Note:
The number of people is less than 1,100.
 
Example
```
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
```

Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        Arrays.sort(people, (a,b) -> {
            int compare = Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]);
            if (compare != 0) {
                return -compare;
            }
            return Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]);
        });
        System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(people));
        List<int[]> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] person: people) {
            list.add(person[1], person);
        }
        return list.toArray(new int[0][0]);
    }
}
